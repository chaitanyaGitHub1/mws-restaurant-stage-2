#  Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course - Evaluation project -  "Mobile Web Specialist Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 1"

**Restaurant Reviews** Stage 1 project.

**Restaurant Reviews** are evaluation projects under [Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024). One needs incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.


## Project Overview

In **Stage One**, one should take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. One must also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Task specification

1. Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .

Notes:

* Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
* Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
* Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
* Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
* Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device

2. Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).

3. Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only **caching** needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

## Getting started

This section contains some instructions to build and run the project.

### Prerequisites

To install:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
2. [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) - command-line tool to compile native addon modules for Node.js
3. [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - build automation tool
4. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) - simple https server

#### Installation notes

gulp-responsive has a dependency on sharp, which in turn requires to compile native Node module.
To compile Node modules [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) is used.

To be able to use it on on Windows, install `windows-build-tools`.
From administrative PowerShell run the following commands: 
`npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`
`npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global`

For more information please refer to https://github.com/chjj/pty.js/issues/60.

### Install

After cloning the project run `npm install` from the root folder.

### Build

From the root folder run `gulp`. This runs projet's task in a sequence:

1. 'img:clean' - cleaning previously generated images
2. 'img:process' - generating a set of responsive images (different resolution and compression level) based on a source image.

### Run

Serving application on localhost:8080 :
`npm start`
